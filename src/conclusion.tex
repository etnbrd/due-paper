\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced a compiler to transform an imbrication of continuation to a sequence.
We defined callbacks and Promise.
We then introduced Due, a new specification similar to Promise, to carry the demonstration of this transformation.
We presented the equivalence between a continuation and a Due, and the composition of this equivalence for imbricated continuations.
And finally, we presented a compiler to automate this transformation on real code bases.

The compiler brings a soft segmentation of the asynchronous operations.
A continuation share its scope with its descendance, \textit{i.e} the following continuations.
While the callback of a Due doesn't share its scope with the following dues.
Their scope are disjoints.
We aim at pushing this independance further.

We saw that the callback of a Due can return another due, to link the next asynchronous operation.
The operations encapsulated by Dues, are communicating via this medium. 
A serie of asynchronous operations operated by Dues is very suggestive of a data flow process.
