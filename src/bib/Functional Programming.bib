abstract = {In previous work we presented functional reactive programming (FRP), a general framework for designing hybrid systems and developing domain-specific languages for related domains. FRP's synchronous dataflow features, like event driven switching, supported by higher-order lazy functional abstractions of Haskell allows rapid development of modular and reusable specifications. In this paper, we look at more closely to the relation of arrowized FRP (AFRP), the FRP implementation, and formal specification of hybrid systems. We show how a formally specified hybrid system can be expressed in FRP and present a constructive proof showing that, for a subset of AFRP programs, there is a corresponding formal hybrid system specification.},

abstract = {Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) extends a host programming language with a notion of time flow. Arrowized FRP (AFRP) is a version of FRP embedded in Haskell based on the arrow combinators. AFRP is a powerful synchronous dataflow programming language with hybrid modeling capabilities, combining advanced synchronous dataflow features with the higher-order lazy functional abstractions of Haskell. In this paper, we describe the AFRP programming style and our Haskell-based implementation. Of particular interest are the AFRP combinators that support dynamic collections and continuation-based switching. We show how these combinators can be used to express systems with an evolving structure that are difficult to model in more traditional dataflow languages.},

@article{Elliott2009,
abstract = {Functional reactive programming (FRP) has simple and powerful semantics, but has resisted efficient implementation. In particular, most past implementations have used demand-driven sampling, which accommodates FRP's continuous time semantics and fits well with the nature of functional programming. Consequently, values are wastefully recomputed even when inputs don't change, and reaction latency can be as high as the sampling period. This paper presents a way to implement FRP that combines data- and demand-driven evaluation, in which values are recomputed only when necessary, and reactions are nearly instantaneous. The implementation is rooted in a new simple formulation of FRP and its semantics and so is easy to understand and reason about. On the road to a new implementation, we'll meet some old friends (monoids, functors, applicative functors, monads, morphisms, and improving values) and make some new friends (functional future values, reactive normal form, and concurrent "unambiguous choice").},
