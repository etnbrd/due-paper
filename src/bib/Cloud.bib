abstract = {Rich mobile applications are characterized by rich functionality, offline usability and portability. However, it isnot trivial to simultaneously satisfy all the three criteria. Existing approaches such stand-alone applications and the thin-client architecture satisfy only a subset of these criteria. In this paper, we show that rich mobile applications can be achieved through the convergence of mobile and cloud computing. We address two main issues in cloud-enabled mobile applications, namely complexity of application development and offline usability. We then propose $\mu$Cloud framework which models a rich mobile application as a graph of components distributed onto mobile devices and the cloud. Lastly, we discuss $\mu$Cloud's major research issues, i.e., workflow language for interactive applications, offline usability, secure and scalable multi-tenancy, portability and energy optimization.},

@article{Mirashe2010,
abstract = {Computing as you know it is about to change, your applications and documents are going to move from the desktop into the cloud. I'm talking about cloud computing, where applications and files are hosted on a "cloud" consisting of thousands of computers and servers, all linked together and accessible via the Internet. With cloud computing, everything you do is now web based instead of being desktop based. You can access all your programs and documents from any computer that's connected to the Internet. How will cloud computing change the way you work? For one thing, you're no longer tied to a single computer. You can take your work anywhere because it's always accessible via the web. In addition, cloud computing facilitates group collaboration, as all group members can access the same programs and documents from wherever they happen to be located. Cloud computing might sound far-fetched, but chances are you're already using some cloud applications. If you're using a web-based email program, such as Gmail or Hotmail, you're computing in the cloud. If you're using a web-based application such as Google Calendar or Apple Mobile Me, you're computing in the cloud. If you're using a file- or photo-sharing site, such as Flickr or Picasa Web Albums, you're computing in the cloud. It's the technology of the future, available to use today.},
