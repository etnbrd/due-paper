To our knowledge, our work is the first to present a transformation from continuation to Promise in Javascript.
This section relates the various work related with ours.
Our work is obviously based on the previous work on Promises and Futures \cite{Liskov1988}, and their specifications in Javascript\footnote{\url{https://promisesaplus.com/}}\footnote{\url{https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html\#sec-promise-objects}}.

Because of its dominant position in the web, Javascript is recently subject to a growing interest in the field of static analysis.
We identified currently two teams working on static analysis for Javascript.

In the Department of Computing, Imperial College London, S. Maffeis, P. Gardner and G. Smith realised a large body of work around the static analysis of Javascript.
Their work is based around an operational semantic\cite{Maffeis2008} to bring program understanding\cite{Smith2011,Gardner2012,Gardner2013}.
Their goal seems to revolve around Security applications of this analysis\cite{Maffeis2009,Maffeis2009a}.
In the industry, there already exist some security tools based on static analysis, we can cite for example, the company Shape Security\footnote{\url{https://shapesecurity.com/}}.
In a collaboration between the programming language research groups at Aarhus University and Universität Freiburg, P. Thiemann, S. Jensen and A. Møller are working on the static analysis of Javascript.

They presented a tool providing type inference using abstract interpretation\cite{Thiemann2005,Jensen2009,Jensen2012}.
Their goal is to improve the tools available to the Javascript developer\cite{Andreasen}.
The industry seems to follow the same trend.
Facebook released on October 26 2014, a static type checker for Javascript : flow\footnote{\url{http://flowtype.org/}}.
Another example is the adaptation of the points-to analysis from L. Andersen's thesis work\cite{Andersen1994} to Javascript\cite{Jang2009}.

Our compiler aggregates user preferences to transparently improve the service for every user.
To our knowledge, we are the first to use principle for software compilation.
A good example of similair work is Aviate\footnote{\url{http://aviate.yahoo.com/}}, an android homescreen which automatically organize smartphone applications into existing categories.
The use of crowd feedbacks is now a very common practice for many web services.
The first example that comes in mind is the search engine suggestions, like Google Autocomplete\footnote{\url{https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/106230?hl=en}}.
Similarly, many services propose a recommendation feature centered on such feedback loops \textit{e.g.} TripAdvisor\footnote{\url{http://www.tripadvisor.com/}}, Yelp\footnote{\url{http://www.yelp.com}}.
But there exist many other examples making use of this network effect \textit{e.g.}
AirBnB\footnote{\url{https://www.airbnb.com}},
Hotel Tonight\footnote{\url{https://www.hoteltonight.com/}},
Uber\footnote{\url{https://www.uber.com/}},
Lyft\footnote{\url{https://www.lyft.com/}},
Home Joy\footnote{\url{https://www.homejoy.com/}},
