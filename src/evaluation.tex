\section{Evaluation} \label{section:evaluation}

To validate our compiler, we used it to compile several Javascript projects likely to contains continuations.
We present the results of these tests.

% \subsection{Projects selection}

The compilation of a project require user interaction.
To conduct the test in a reasonable time, we limit the test set to a minimum.
We search the \textit{Node Package Manager} database to restrict the set to \textit{Node.js} projects.
We refine the selection to web applications depending on the web framework \textit{express}, but not on the most common asynchronous libraries such as \textit{Q} and \textit{Async}.
We refine further the selection to projects using the test frameworks \textit{mocha} in its default configuration.
The test set contains 65 projects.
This subset is very small, and cannot represent the wide possibilities of Javascript.
However, we believe it is sufficient to represent a majority of common cases.

% \subsection{Run the tests}

For each project, we verify that the project is correctly tested, and pass the tests.
During the compilation, the user identifies the compatible continuations among the detected callbacks.
We test the compilation result, and verify that the test result is the same that the original tests.
The compilation result should pass the tests as well.
This is not a strong validation, but it assure the compiler to work in the most common cases.

% \subsection{Results}

On the 65 projects tested, almost a majority, 29 (45\%), does not contain any compatible continuations.
We reckon that these projects use continuations the compiler didn't detect.
10 (15\%) projects are not compilable because they contain \texttt{with} or \texttt{eval} statements.
5 (8\%) projects used less common asynchronous libraries we didn't filter previously.
4 (6\%) projects are not syntactically correct.
4 (6\%) projects fail their tests before the compilation.
3 (5\%) projects are not tested.
And finally, 10 (15\%) projects compiled successfully.
The compiler did not fail to compile any projects.

Over the successfully compiled projects, the compiler detected 172 callbacks.
We manually identified 56 of them to be compatible continuations.
One project contains 20 continuations, the others contains between 9 and 1 continuations each.
On the 56 continuations, 36 are single, and 20 continuations involved in an imbrication.
There are 5 imbrications containing 2 continuations, 2 imbrication containing 3 continuations, and one imbrication containing 4 continuations.
The result of these tests prove the compiler to be able to successfully transform imbrications of continuations.



























% Tested applications :

% rest-api-express            -> OK

% socket-testing              -> OK (partial) the project is broken, but it seems broken in the same way before and after the compilation :)
% nodeExample                 -> OK (partial) read-simple.js and write-simple.js compile successfully (the only two files to contain continuation). but the project compiler breaks, I suspect it is because of some !# stuffs.
